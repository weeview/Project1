                    <p>The story is set in a distant future, where a group of teens are mysteriously teleported into a
                        giant, stone maze. Not only has their memory been cleared, but they also have no indication as
                        to why they have ended up in this position and what means they must take to escape.</p>
                    <p>Their situation complicates even further, given that the maze doors close every evening. During
                        the night, vicious monsters roam free and devour any humans in their way. The teens, who have
                        declared themselves “Grovers”, attempt to map the maze, but doing so poses obvious threats to
                        their safety.</p>
                    <p>Enter Thomas, a new “Grover” arriving in the maze. As he learns his way about this new reality,
                        the story follows his point of view in first person perspective. Thomas eventually comes to
                        terms with living as a Grover, but one night, as he crosses into the outer layer of the maze,
                        his world is turned inside out.</p>
                    <p>Over time, Thomas must confront these imminent struggles, while also attempting to solve the
                        grand puzzle of the maze. Readers are kept on edge through the entire novel, with hidden twists
                        and turns on every turn of the chapter.

                        I would certainly recommend this read for teens and adults alike. While it’s true that the novel
                        is aimed at a young demographic, its plot is engaging for even some of the most mature readers.
                        The ending simply cannot be predicted, leaving readers to make their own speculations about the
                        mysterious origins of the maze.</p>
                    <p>One complaint I might file is that there is somewhat of a lack of character development. The plot
                        is so action-packed that it would see Dashner decided to leave out some of the more subtle
                        nuances of a good novel.

                        If you decide to not read this novel, I would suggest as an alternative “The Lord of the Flies”
                        by William Golding. The plot bears some parallels to that of the Maze Runner, but makes up for a
                        majority of its imperfections.

                        Overall, “The Maze Runner” stands to be a top-quality post-apocalyptic teen-novel, making for an
                        engaging read. The story sheds light on the natural instincts of teens under true isolation. In
                        doing so, it echoes a number of themes which leave readers to draw meaningful questions about
                        life, nature, and the purpose of humanity.</p>
